      <title>Locally installing OCaml programs and libraries</title>

      <para>
        Locally installed files are files that are installed directly by
        the system administrator, in contrast to files installed through Debian
        packages. Installation and use of locally installed OCaml related
        programs is out of the scope of this document. However, in order to
        have it work with a standard Debian installation, a local system
        administrator should follow these guidelines:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Executable files should be installed
              in <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename>.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Shared libraries (for C bindings) should be installed
              in <filename>/usr/local/lib/ocaml/stublibs/</filename>
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Basically, every other file should be installed
              in <filename>/usr/local/lib/ocaml/</filename>. This
              includes in particular bytecode libraries
              (<filename>*.cma</filename>), native libraries
              (<filename>*.cmxa</filename>), bytecode object files
              (<filename>*.cmo</filename>), native object files
              (<filename>*.cmx</filename>), native plugin object files 
              (<filename>*.cmxs</filename>), static libraries
              (<filename>*.a</filename>) and <filename>META</filename>
              files.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
        The default configuration of <filename>ocamlfind</filename> (the OCaml
        library manager recommended in Debian) first looks for a local
        installation of libraries and then for libraries installed by Debian
        packages.
      </para>

      <warning>
        <para>
          The <varname>+</varname> preceding any library in the
          <option>-I</option> of <command>ocamlc</command> or
          <command>ocamlopt</command> won't be expanded to the local standard
          library path. You need to specify the path entirely.
        </para>
      </warning>
